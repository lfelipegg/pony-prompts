# pony-prompts

This document was made to test different prompt styles in Pony SDXL. I will be using the next things for this test:

- Software:[ComfyUi](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
- Workflow:[SDXL Workflow made by me](/workflows/Pony_Prompt_Testing-SDXL-Text2Img.json)
- Model (Pony SDXL):[30104 v7.0](https://civitai.com/models/593865/30104)
- VAE: [SDXL VAE](https://civitai.com/models/296576/sdxl-vae)

## Initial Settings

The [SDXL Workflow made by me](/workflows/Pony_Prompt_Testing-SDXL-Text2Img.json) has preloaded all the settings, but If you need the initial image settings, you can find them in the next [JSON](/images/initial/initial.json).
